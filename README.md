Designed and built from the ground up by a dedicated SEO agency, the Aardvark SEO addon gives you full control that no other SEO plugin does, from managing directs to generating schema.

We aim to follow Statamic's release schedule and support policy (https://statamic.dev/release-schedule-support-policy) as closely as possible. Please refer to their support policy for guidance on end of life dates.

Please note, Aardvark v4 was skipped in order to match Statamic's updated release schedule.
